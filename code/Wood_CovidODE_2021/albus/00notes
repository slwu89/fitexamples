* Requires R.

* Uses R libraries mgcv, parallel and timeDate

* data and fixed parameters are from Konck et al. supplementary material
  except where noted in the paper. 

* Model is coded in C in albus-gl.c

* To compile .c use, e.g. ...
  R CMD SHLIB albus.c
  ... to get albus.so.
  -- windows users require Rtools to do this

* .r file contains all the code you need and is a bit messy
  (this is a zero budget exercise).
  - functions come first, then after the 'setwd' command, that you
    need to edit, comes the code to do the fitting.
  - setup.model gets data, constants etc (and sources data.r).
  - fit.model fits the model. On 7 physical cores it takes about
    an hour to do all 7 regions (much longer than for the original
    model as there are far more parameters, and the smoothing
    parameter selection requires multiple fits). 
  - Then come code to  paste the results back into the regional
    data objects and get derivatives for delta method (1-2 minutes).
  - plots follow.
